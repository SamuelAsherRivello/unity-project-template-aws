TODO List


// TIME : 1-2 days
* Add delete user
* Move code to "RMC Backend"

//EASY ONBOARDING
* make 'create table' C# so LESS setup is needed on backend?

//LATENCY
* add 3rd output to always show the Latency

//OPTIONAL
* Rethink "JawsConfiguration". Remove menuitem? add/remove fields?
* Store token to disc and keep the session alive? (or just document how its possible = yes)
* Add the amazon-opens-browser to login? That's cool but doesn't prove out much architecture-wise. Maybe no.

//ERRORS
* There are likely many missing errors. Sanity check at least, pass bad data to EVERY call once. Validate UI updates properly

//EVENTS
//Pass response as argument to EVERY event? (Needed in production, but maybe not here in demo)

// TIME : 1 day
* Update sar.com/backend-portfolio
* Update packages page to show new one
* Update sar.com/rmc-jaws and /rmc-aws to point to the same page
* Create medium articles (1. backend, 2 amazon, 3. firebase, 4. beamable, 5. rmc backend
